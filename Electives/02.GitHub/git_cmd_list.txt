// Branching

git branch (displays all branches. Current branch is with a star *)

git branch branchName (creates new branch)

git checkout branchName (changes branch to branchName)

git merge branchName1 branchName2 (merges two branches)

git branch -d branchName (deletes branch)

git branch -a (shows brances on remote and branches on local)

// Remote

git remote (displays all remotes)

git remote add remoteName remoteUrl (adds remote, first remoteName is usually origin)
